        <p>We went to Niagara Falls! It was the first time I went to Niagara Falls on August 15, 2014! My first reaction was sort of like a child accidentally getting left behind a candy store. When me and my family got close, I thought it was raining! I got real sad, but then I was wondering why people have these yellow raincoats. It hit me; the falls was so strong that it created its own dense humid atmosphere. I guarantee that anyone close to falls <b>cannot</b> avoid being wet without raincoats. For people who have already seen Niagara Falls, you know what I mean, but for those who have not seen the falls, I can't tell you much but here is a picture of it.</p>

    <p>Nearing the end of summer, my family and I decided to go to Canada's Wonderland! TV ads on CW (Canada's Wonderland) makes it seem small and look like your casual county fare.<b> Boy was I wrong!</b> CW is gigantic! About 70 American Footballl Fields can fit in it! In addition to size, Canada's Wonderland has endless, wave after wave of rides and fun things to do! A simple to-do list won't be enough to fully discover Canada's Wonderland. Like when we went to the waterslide and the scary <em>Leviathan</em> and some games <em>especially</em> Laser Tag. At the end of the day, me and my family ended up in a petting zoo where I got to see many cute and cuddly animals. Every animal was great, but I have to give it to the rabbit. I wish I could've taken her home, but I wasn't allowed too. Here is the picture of the cute little bunny.
